## Summary

## Metadata

- The dcterms:created value must be updated to 2021-06-01.
- Ontology imports should be removed from the metadata section in all SHACL artifacts.
- Detailed findings are documented in the metadata review notebook:
    - [metadata review notebook](https://raw.githack.com/OP-TED/epo-tools/refs/heads/main/notebooks/__marimo__/metadata-review.html)

## SHACL

- Several improvements are proposed, as described in
  the [SHACL review notebook](https://raw.githack.com/op-ted/epo-tools/refs/heads/main/notebooks/__marimo__/shacl-review.html)

- As I understand, the artifacts are all generated by Model2Owl, so most required changes may need to be integrated
  there later on.
- The exception is the critical issue: Controlled vocabularies are currently represented only as sh:class skos:Concept.
    - It was mentioned that this design decision was made during a Working Group meeting.
    - However, the rationale for this decision is undocumented, to propertly assess this I would need:
      - A explicit justification for omitting value constraints.
      - So that we can provide documentation outlining the scope or limitations of the current SHACL shapes.

### OWL

- There are redefinitions of external vocabularies within the OWL restriction files, which should be avoided.

- Affected files
    - /eCatalogue/owl_ontology/eCatalogue_restrictions.ttl
    - /eAccess/owl_ontology/eAccess_restrictions.ttl
    - /ePO_core/owl_ontology/ePO_core_restrictions.ttl
- Investigation details can be found in the OWL review notebook:
    - https://raw.githack.com/OP-TED/epo-tools/refs/heads/main/notebooks/__marimo__/owl-review.html

### Immediate Actions

- Set dcterms:created to 2021-06-01.

- Remove all ontology imports from SHACL metadata.

I'll Execute a script to **temporarily** handle redefinitions of external vocabularies until Model2Owl can handle it.

### Deferred

- Further discussion on detailed metadata refinements
- Controlled vocabularies
