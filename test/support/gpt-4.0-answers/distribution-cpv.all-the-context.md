# Giving the complete ontology as context

The context window is not enough to hold the complete ontology, the instructions were ignored

The context needs to be smaller to fit in the window.

Question: What is the smallest context that contains the necessary information?

If epo:hasMainClassification isn't directly connecting notices to their classifications in your data model, we'll need
to check the correct relationships defined in your UML for notices and classifications. Let's revisit the available
relationships and predicates that might connect notices to their main classifications.

Assuming your ontology uses typical modeling practices, a notice could be connected to its classifications through a
different predicate, perhaps involving intermediary resources or a more complex path. Commonly used predicates might
include things like epo:belongsTo, epo:hasClassification, or even through some kind of procedural link like epo:
relatedTo.

Since I don't have the specifics of your UML, I suggest reviewing your model to identify the exact predicate that links
a notice to its classification. If you can provide the correct predicate or a bit more detail about the relationship
structure, I can help formulate the right query.

It seems there was some confusion; I didn't receive the details of the PlantUML diagram. Without seeing the specific UML
diagram, I can't confirm the exact relationships and predicates used in your ontology. If you can share the relevant
portion of the UML diagram that details how notices are connected to classifications or just describe the relationships
and properties used, that would be really helpful.

Once I have the correct relationships and predicates from your UML, I'll be able to craft an accurate SPARQL query for
you.
