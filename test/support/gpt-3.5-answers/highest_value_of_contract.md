My friend, I have this ontology:

<<SHACL of view>>

I want a query that returns the highest value published for a contract award for a given date?

To retrieve the highest value published for a contract award for a given date, you can use a SPARQL query against your ontology. Assuming the award values are represented by the property a4g:hasAwardedValue and the publication date is represented by the property a4g:hasPublicationDate, you can use the following query:


```sparql
PREFIX a4g: <http://data.europa.eu/a4g/ontology#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?awardValue
WHERE {
  ?award a rdf:type a4g:AwardOutcome .
  ?award a4g:hasAwardedValue ?awardValue .
  ?award a4g:comprisesTenderAwardOutcome ?tenderOutcome .
  ?tenderOutcome a4g:hasPublicationDate ?publicationDate .
  FILTER(xsd:date(?publicationDate) = "your_desired_date")
}
ORDER BY DESC(?awardValue)
LIMIT 1
```

explain to me your reasoning to add:

?tenderOutcome a4g:hasPublicationDate ?publicationDate .

Certainly! In the given ontology, the a4g:AwardOutcome class is associated with the a4g:comprisesTenderAwardOutcome property, which links it to instances of a4g:TenderAwardOutcome. However, to filter the awards based on the publication date, we need to traverse the ontology to find the publication date associated with each tender outcome.

Therefore, we need to establish a path from the a4g:AwardOutcome to the publication date. Since the publication date is associated with the tender outcomes, we need to follow the path:

```rust
?a4g:AwardOutcome --> a4g:comprisesTenderAwardOutcome --> ?a4g:TenderAwardOutcome --> a4g:hasPublicationDate --> ?publicationDate
```
By adding the triple pattern ?tenderOutcome a4g:hasPublicationDate ?publicationDate, we are effectively traversing the ontology to link the a4g:AwardOutcome to the publication date associated with the corresponding a4g:TenderAwardOutcome. This allows us to filter the awards based on the publication date in the subsequent FILTER clause.
