Ok, my friend let's try another thing.

I'm giving you a plantUML description, describing UML we use to represent classes and properties

There are some rules:

1. If a class extends from other, then it inherits all their properties, for example, given the following UML

```plantuml
class "ex:Bob" {

}
class "ex:Dog" {
    ex:hasNicknae : rdf:PlainLiteral [0..3]
}

"ex:Dog" <|-- "ex:Bob"
```

We know a dog might have up to 3 nicknames. Bob is a dog, therefore it can have such nicknames.

Ok, here is the description of our UML.

{{test/support/llm/distribution-cpv.context.plantuml}}

I'm interested in getting data about the main classifications of a procedure. In particular I want the main
classifications connected to all the notice published on "20230911". If you can, give me the distributions using counts
and groups

Assume I have a triplestore with the data in and Give me SPARQL I can run. 

Always use the attributes described in the UML, do NOT add new ones. Also use predicates where appropiate according to
the UML.

Always answer me in markdown.

## GPT

Based on your UML and the request to get the main classifications of a procedure related to notices published on a
specific date ("20230911"), we can write a SPARQL query to achieve this. The query will need to:

    Identify notices (epo:Notice) that have a specific publication date (assuming this is stored in a date-related property which you haven't explicitly defined, so we'll use a hypothetical property like epo:publicationDate for the example).
    Traverse from these notices to the procedures (epo:Procedure) they refer to using the epo:refersToProcedure relationship.
    From the procedures, access the linked purpose (epo:Purpose) through the epo:hasPurpose relationship.
    Finally, extract the main classifications (at-voc:cpv) from the purposes using the epo:hasMainClassification relationship.

Here's the SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX epo: <http://example.org/epo/>
PREFIX at-voc: <http://example.org/at-voc/>

SELECT ?mainClassification (COUNT(?mainClassification) AS ?count)
WHERE {
?notice a epo:Notice ;
epo:hasPublicationDate "2023-09-11"^^xsd:date ;
epo:refersToProcedure ?procedure .
?procedure epo:hasPurpose ?purpose .
?purpose epo:hasMainClassification ?mainClassification .
}
GROUP BY ?mainClassification
ORDER BY DESC(?count)
```

Explanation:

    PREFIX declarations: Define the prefixes to shorten URIs in the query.
    SELECT clause: Selects the main classifications and counts of each.
    WHERE clause: Describes the pattern to match:
        Find a epo:Notice with a specific publication date.
        Follow the epo:refersToProcedure relationship to get related procedures.
        Access the purpose of each procedure via epo:hasPurpose.
        Retrieve the main classifications from the purpose using epo:hasMainClassification.
    GROUP BY: Groups the results by the main classification.
    ORDER BY: Orders the results by the count in descending order to see the most common classifications first.

This query will give you the count of each main classification for procedures linked to notices published on September
11, 2023. Adjust the PREFIX URIs and date formats as needed to fit your actual data schema and storage details.

## Me

- I change `epo:hasPublicationDate "2023-09-11"^^xsd:date ;` to `epo:hasPublicationDate "20230911";`

- I run the query, does not work
- I add the prefixes

PREFIX epo: <http://data.europa.eu/a4g/ontology#>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX euvoc: <http://publications.europa.eu/ontology/euvoc#>
PREFIX at: <http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/concept-status/>

it works
