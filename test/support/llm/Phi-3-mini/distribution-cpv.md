## Me

Ok, my friend let's try another thing.

I'm giving you a plantUML description, describing UML we use to represent classes and properties

There are some rules:

1. If a class extends from other, then it inherits all their properties, for example, given the following UML

```plantuml
class "ex:Bob" {

}
class "ex:Dog" {
    ex:hasNicknae : rdf:PlainLiteral [0..3]
}

"ex:Dog" <|-- "ex:Bob"
```

We know a dog might have up to 3 nicknames. Bob is a dog, therefore it can have such nicknames.

Ok, here is the description of our UML.

[epo-3.0.1-distribution-slice.plantuml](./epo-3.0.1-distribution-slice.plantuml)

I'm interested in getting data about the main classifications of a procedure. In particular I want the main
classifications connected to all the notice published on "20230911", use this format of dates. If you can, give me the distributions using counts
and groups.

Assume I have a triplestore with the data in and Give me SPARQL I can run.

Always use the attributes described in the UML, do NOT add new ones. Also use predicates where appropiate according to
the UML.

When you see a prefix like epo: epo-cat: etc, they will be all the same: @prefix a4g: <http://data.europa.eu/a4g/ontology#> .

Always answer me in markdown.
